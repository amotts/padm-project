Needs:
- RRT
    - accept a start, goal
    - output a sequence of poses
    - detects collisions
    - find closest node
    - takes step
    - finds random point
    - cuttoff point -> failed

    Steps
    1) check goal and start locations for collisions with obstacles via collision function
    2) create list of rrt nodes
    3) limiting loop for number of iterations until fail
    4) take sample point
    5) find nearest node by using argmin of distance function
    6) get point step distance along line
    7) check point for collision with collision function
    8) if no collision: add to queue and check if is goal state. if so return path
